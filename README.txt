This is the Admin by Timo Streich

In each Version a readme file explains, how to use this version

All rights reserve

From version 1.2 onwards, download the latest version, open it on the server where it is to run and log in with the following data:

Username:

inizialUser

Password:

After the login you have to change your login Datas and you login again, then you can use the admin

When you only wants to update, save your content of .htusers.txt in src/.htdatabase/ and replace with that the new content.
